# Project Auth API

This was a pair project, to create a page were you can register/login. After the user is loggedin it's directed to a page that shows content only for the authenticated user. If the user have not created any content yet, our page will show a greeting message and the form for posting.
The authenticated site have a logout button, which resets the accesToken in our Redux state.

## The problem

We did the entire project coding together with live share. 

Started by creating the API, with two modules User and UserPost. It was very interesting to work with two modules and learn more about using data from one of them to store in the other.

We created different endpoints and learned how to authenticate the user before granting access.
In previous project we have sent data in the Body, in this project we gained valuable info about the Header and Authorization key.
We deployed our API and set up the database before starting on the frontend.
Once we started on our frontend, we had to go back to make some adjustment to our API.

We had our upcoming final project in mind when doing this project. Trying out things that we can build on when we start that. 

We used SO, our live coding sessions, team-mates, google and chatgpt to find solutions to the problems we ran into.

There are things that can be improved in this project. For example, adjusting the size of the form. 
Remove the error message when you change from login/register and when you start typing in a new username.
